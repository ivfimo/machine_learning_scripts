# **README: TensorFlow-Keras Binary Classification Model**
-   This README explains the step-by-step process used in the Python script to develop, train, evaluate, and interpret a binary classification model using TensorFlow-Keras. The dataset and code focus on machine learning techniques such as data preprocessing, model development, and SHAP-based explainability. Using your Google Colab file (Google account needed) i. copy and paste the script and upload the input TF-K_dataset.csv file, and ii. to visualize each STEP by STEP details on the approach: https://t.ly/V8fe8
### **1. Loading the Dataset** 
-   The dataset should be in CSV format, and you can upload it to your Google Colab environment
-   The target column is identified as the class, and the rest are features
### **2. Handling Non-Numeric Columns**
-   The script identifies non-numeric columns in the dataset
### **3. Binary Encoding for Target Variable**
-   The target column (class) is transformed into binary labels using LabelEncoder
### **4. Class Distribution Check**
-   The script verifies the class distribution and informs you of the number of instances in each class
### **5. Train-Test Split**
-   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split with stratification
### **6. Feature Scaling**
-   The script applies StandardScaler to standardize the features
### **7. Model Definition**
-   The model is defined with TensorFlow using a Sequential neural network
### **8. Cross-Validation with Stratified K-Folds**
-   StratifiedKFold ensures class balance during cross-validation, and class weights are calculated dynamically
### **9. Training on Full Training Set**
-   After cross-validation, the final model is trained on the entire training set with dynamically calculated class weights
### **10. Model Evaluation on Test Set**
-   Predictions are made on the test set and evaluation metrics are computed
### **11. SHAP Explainability**
-   The SHAP library is used to explain the model's predictions
## **Outputs and Metrics**
### **1. Cross-Validation AUC Scores:**
-   Mean AUC scores from the training folds are displayed
### **2. Test Set Evaluation:**
-   ROC-AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report are printed for test set performance
### **3. SHAP Summary Plot:**
-   A visualization that highlights the most important features driving the model's predictions
## **Dependencies**
-   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands in Google Colab:
### !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow shap
## **File Structure**
-   Script: Run the Python script directly after ensuring all dependencies are installed and the dataset is available

# **README: Binary Classification using MLPClassifier**
-   This Python script implements a binary classification model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from scikit-learn. The script preprocesses the dataset, trains an artificial neural network (ANN), evaluates its performance using multiple metrics, and extracts feature importance based on model weights. Using your Google Colab file (Google account needed) i. copy and paste the script and upload the input MLPClassifier_dataset.csv file, and ii. to visualize each STEP by STEP details on the approach: https://t.ly/4FLJ0
### **1. Load the Dataset**
-   The script reads a CSV file containing the dataset
### **2. Data Preprocessing**
-   The dataset is split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, and feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler
### **3. Train the MLP Classifier**
-   The MLP Classifier is initialized with the following parameters
### **4. Model Evaluation**
-   Predictions are made on the test set, and various evaluation metrics are calculated
### **5. Feature Importance Extraction**
-   The script extracts the weights connecting the input and hidden layers to determine feature importance
##   Expected Output
-    After running the script, the following information is displayed
-    ROC AUC Score
-    F1 Score
-    Accuracy Score
-    Precision Score
-    Recall Score
-    Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
## **Dependencies**
-    Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands in Google Colab
###  !pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
##   Usage
-    Replace the "path_to_dataset.csv" in pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset.csv') with the actual file path of your dataset
##   Run the script in a Python environment:
-    bash
##   python script.py
